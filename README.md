# Fraud Detection Analysis
Analysing and predicting fraudulent transactions 

## Initial Data Analysis 
The first step I took after I initially cleaned the data, 
which only took the scaling of the amount column, 
was to look for any correlations in the fields.

The heat map shown that some correlations do seem to exist. 
But this becomes more apparent when looking at a cluster map of the same data.

The next steps will be to start comparing models for predicting 
fraudulent transactions. :)
